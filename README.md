# Grassroots Green @ Calvin University


## Vision Statement

As the app developers of Grassroots Green, we strive to provide an app that will:

- Educate the Calvin community on why they should be eating more plant-based foods and how they can be making those decisions.

- Affect the Supply and Demand for vegetarian and vegan options in the Calvin dining halls through exchanging information between dining services and the students and staff who eat in the dining halls.

- Motivate students through competition to be eating more plant-based foods through goal setting and inter-dorm competitions.

### User Experience

Front and center in the app will be information about plant based foods, and the carbon footprint of regular meat diets. Various stats can be displayed with links to external sources if a user wishes to learn more. A user will be able to track when, where, and what meat or plant alternative they ate at the last meal they had. They also will be able to edit or delete older food entries in case they were entered wrong. Users also will be able to comment and give feedback on various meat and plant alternative options, regardless if they were consumed or not. Once implemented, users will be able to signify which dorm they are in, and view leader boards of the various dorms during inter dorm competitions.

### Platform

We chose Flutter because it gives us the ability to code in one language for both iOS and Android. Approximately half of students on campus use iOS and the other half use Android. If our goal is to exchange information between students, Grassroots Green, and dining services, we wouldnâ€™t want to code only in Android native, which wouldn't allow iOS users to use the app. By reaching all students with both iPhones and Androids, we can educate and motivate more of the student population. Additionally the ability to see code updates live is beneficial for the development process. Less time waiting for the app to build means more time for development.
