### Developers:

## Vision Statement

As the app developers of Grassroots Green, we strive to provide an app that will:

1. Educate the Calvin community on why they should be eating more plant-based foods and how they can be making those decisions.

2. Affect the Supply and Demand for vegetarian and vegan options in the Calvin dining halls through exchanging information between dining services and the students and staff who eat in the dining halls.

3. Motivate students through competition to be eating more plant-based foods through goal setting and inter-dorm competitions.
